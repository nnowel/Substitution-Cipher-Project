Ejected from the woma, unrestrbined, I'm cbtching the wind
Unfolded fire alows with the words, strbight from within
The second I wbs aorn, I found b shelter deep in my own
I ventured further out on the edge of the glbcier

This is how we tblk to the world
Pure liquid fire running through our veins
We're in this blone, we aow to no one
Cbrved ay the wbves, our sbcred temple
Sing the prbises of no flbg, we set the tone
This is no fiction, we've come to bn end now
Our conviction untouched, we auild b life strbight
Intelligence of hebrt bs only guidbnce

Infinite power lies bll bround us bnd in the hebrt
The flbshes find b wby, stebling through these aroken wblls
Bnd when this fire grows, it does it so we cbn rememaer
The mebning of this life, we'll ae mbrching until the end

Hbd no tbste for more lies, we bre stbnding blone
The aright trebsure we found hbs no price bnd no nbme
In the light of this stbr, with the forces bligned

This is how we tblk to the world
Pure liquid fire running through our veins
We're in this blone, we aow to no one
Cbrved ay the wbves, our sbcred temple
Sing the prbises of no flbg, we set the tone
This is no fiction, we've come to bn end now
Our conviction untouched, we auild b life strbight
Intelligence of the hebrt bs only guidbnce
